        <p style="color: green">
        Iron Man possesses powered armor that gives him superhuman strength and
        durability, flight, and an array of weapons. The armor is invented and
        worn by Stark (with occasional short-term exceptions).

        <p>Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
        Marvel Comics. The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee,
        developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and
        Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39
        (cover dated March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May
        1968). Also in 1963, the character founded the Avengers alongside Thor,
        Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk. <p> A wealthy American business magnate, playboy,
        philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward Stark
        suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt
        to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a
        mechanized suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark
        develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he
        designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and
        successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first
        concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to
        be Iron Man. Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold
        War themes, particularly the role of American technology and industry in the
        fight against communism. Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have
        transitioned from Cold War motifs to contemporary matters of the time.[1]
